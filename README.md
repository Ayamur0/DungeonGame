# DungeonGame

The game idea is strongly inspired by „The Binding of Isaac“, a randomly generated action RPG shooter with roguelite elements. An important point during development was that the levels can be randomly generated. The RPG elements are characterised by the player's stats, which can be improved with the help of items. 

The aim of the game is to advance as far as possible into the dungeon with each attempt and defeat as many enemies as possible. With different weapons and items as well as the randomly generated levels, each attempt should be different and offer a new challenge.
